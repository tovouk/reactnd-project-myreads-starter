# MyReads Project

This is a completed project that shows a grid of books and categorizes them by status (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read).
You can search for and add a book using certain search terms which can be found at SEARCH_TERMS.md or by visiting the search page.
You can also change the status for these books. Only books that belong to a shelf will be displayed on the home page.

## TLDR

Run npm install, then npm start to run this project at the project root level (ie /reactnd-project-myreads-starter if cloned directly)
